# Terminal-AriaNg-For-Android
一个用shell写的简单的AriaNg终端控制程序，在Neoterm或者其他的终端模拟器上运行。
 
分为两个版本，其中Neoterm版本只能在Neoterm里面才能安装使用，可以不需要root(没有root导致无法按照系统进程运行，无法访问外置sdcard)。安卓独立版本安装后则任何终端模拟器都可以用。

A simple AriaNg controler created with shell,running on Terminal emulater for Android.

It has two of its version.The one was called "For_Neoterm",which means it can only be installed or run in Neoterm.It doesn't require user to be root(running without being root would cause many problem such as once you terminated Neoterm,aria2c died with Neoterm.And you will not be able to download files into microSD card.).
Another one was called "For_Android",which means should be installed into Android system.It requires root and Unlock BootLoader.
